# Marketing Analysis

Two examples of leveraging data to generate valuable business insights for data-driven decision-making.

# Panasonic TV Sales

In the `PanasonicTV.ipynb` file, we review consumer report data on TV products. From Panasonic’s perspective, we analyze the data and provide recommendations that could help increase sales.

Key Questions to Consider:

- How does Panasonic perform in each feature (user rating category) compared to its competitors?
- Which features do customers value the most?
- Is investing in features where users rate Panasonic lower than competitors the best strategy?
- If not, what alternative recommendations should be considered?
- How should features be ranked in terms of priority for investment?

# Advertising Strategy Optimization

In the `ad_strategy_optimization.ipynb` file, we examine a company's ad investment data across various publishers and offer recommendations to enhance advertising strategies and maximize ROI.

Key Questions to Consider:

- Does Google need improvements in search-side copy? Does Yahoo need improvements in website-side copy?
- The company expects that exact-match and phrase-match keywords will provide a higher ROA compared to broad-match keywords. As they update their strategy, they are considering bidding only on exact and phrase-match keywords. Is this a good decision?
- The company believes that its global audience (targeted through Google Global, MSN Global, and Yahoo Global) does not purchase its top-of-the-line products. Should they continue investing in advertising to a global audience? What do you recommend?
- Should the company’s search-side strategies differ for the U.S. audience versus the global audience?
- What strategies would you suggest to improve performance for each publisher?
